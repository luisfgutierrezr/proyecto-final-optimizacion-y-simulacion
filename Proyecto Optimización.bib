	abstract = {This paper proposal is to investigate and understand the performance of the elevator systemr systems to optimize people traffic. Discrete event systems methodology is used in conjunction with heuristic optimization algorithm aiming to find the best scenario/symetric that reduces waiting time in elevators queues. The system modeling considers passive elements (queues) and active (processors/servers). The results show that changes in elevator scenario can shorten queuing time by up to 12.82\% and with the optimization scenario 31,83\%.},

	abstract = {Social distancing standards implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative effects on vertical traffic. We describe a model and use it to predict the elevator traffic under social distancing in a university classroom building, and study the effects of four interventions aimed at improving this traffic. Discrete event-based simulation is used to study whether the lift group meets the forecasted demand when the car capacity is restricted far below its ordinary value to accommodate social distancing. Four low-cost interventions are simulated alone and in combination to quantify the improvements they offer. All four interventions show some improvement, and the combination of all four interventions gives the greatest improvement.
            Practical application: Implementing social distancing standards may disproportionately lower the car capacity relative to the building population and thus negatively affect vertical traffic. Building managers seeking to implement low-cost measures to improve elevator traffic under these conditions may look to the percentage improvements described here to aid them in selecting interventions appropriate to their buildings.},

	abstract = {Passenger waiting time in a lobby and ride time in a car give a good indication of the service capability of an elevator group. If several cars are in the same group, these parameters are too complicated to model in a closed form. In this paper, procedures for modelling elevator performance and passenger traffic in a generic building are described. Elevator dynamics and control, call allocation and passenger traffic modelling are described. Simulated interval and load values are compared with theoretical results, and variances in simulation results are investigated. According to typical simulation results, there is no direct connection between interval and passenger waiting times, as is often assumed. The interval depends on the elevator bank configuration and elevator performance capabilities. Performance indicators, such as the number of starts and cycle times, become saturated even at low traffic intensities. The waiting times, in addition to elevator performance, depend on the passenger traffic patterns and, during heavy traffic, service level is greatly affected by the call allocation algorithm.},
